## Using the documentation

When using code blocks in this documentation, it's helpful to hover over and take a look at the `VS Code` style tips that are provided. This is all based on the types that are used in the `Model Match` codebase, and can make it easier to understand the code. 

Take a look at this example:

```ts twoslash
type Helpful = 'TypeScript can help you to understand the API better.'
// ---cut---

function isThisHelpful(message: Helpful) {
  return message
}
```
